## Farmwork issues and future tasks

---


### Transaction page

- Add pagination



### Budger planning page

Need to think of possibly adding functionality to display and have multiple budgets to work with
rather than one like it's right now.


### Feed Calculator Page

- Add option to calculate a complete grain finish for 2 last months from 500lb animal to 700lb without 
    any hay for the last 60 days


### Feeds Page

- If even there needs to get/store more information on feeds (things such as mineral components etc...), consider moving feed properties to another
    separate table with structure "name" : "value".



### Reports Page 

Just display with good search functionlity but without ability to add or modify anything
